# Vector Calculus

This section covers vector calculus concepts essential for advanced quantitative finance.

## Topics Covered

- Vector Fields
- Partial Derivatives
- Gradients
- Divergence and Curl
- Line and Surface Integrals
- Applications in Finance

## Vector Fields

A vector field assigns a vector to each point in space, commonly used in:
- Flow dynamics
- Optimization landscapes
- Financial modeling

## Gradients

The gradient of a scalar function $f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$ is:

$$\nabla f = \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}, ..., \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n}\right)$$

## Partial Derivatives

For functions of multiple variables, partial derivatives measure the rate of change with respect to one variable while holding others constant.

### Applications in Finance

- **Portfolio optimization**: Gradients help find optimal asset allocations
- **Risk measures**: Partial derivatives quantify sensitivity to market factors
- **Options pricing**: Greeks are partial derivatives of option prices

## Divergence

The divergence of a vector field $\mathbf{F} = (F_1, F_2, F_3)$ is:

$$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial F_3}{\partial z}$$

## Line Integrals

Line integrals are used in:
- Path-dependent options
- Transaction cost modeling
- Portfolio rebalancing strategies

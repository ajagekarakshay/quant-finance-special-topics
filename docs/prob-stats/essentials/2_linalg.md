# Linear Algebra

This section covers essential linear algebra concepts for quantitative finance.

## Topics Covered

- Vectors and Vector Spaces
- Matrices and Matrix Operations
- Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
- Matrix Decompositions
- Applications in Finance

## Vector Spaces

A vector space is a collection of objects called vectors that can be added together and multiplied by scalars.

## Matrix Operations

### Basic Operations

Matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication form the foundation of linear algebra.

### Determinants

The determinant of a matrix provides important information about the matrix properties.

## Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

For a square matrix $A$, an eigenvector $v$ and eigenvalue $\lambda$ satisfy:

$$Av = \lambda v$$

These concepts are crucial in:
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Risk modeling
- Portfolio optimization

## Applications in Finance

Linear algebra is extensively used in:
- Portfolio theory
- Factor models
- Risk management
- Options pricing models
